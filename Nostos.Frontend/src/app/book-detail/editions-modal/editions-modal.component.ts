 * wrong.
 *
 * It is a modal rather than a panel in the details rail because the job needs
 * room the rail does not have (a search field, a result list, per-candidate
 * disambiguation) and because link/unlink restructure a relationship across
 * books rather than editing this book's own fields. Keeping it out of the
 * Edit Book form matters for a concrete reason: that form is a deferred save
 * (`Save Changes` fires the one PUT, `Cancel` discards), while these mutations
 * apply immediately — an unlink confirmed inside that form would survive a
 * Cancel that the user believed undid everything.
 *
 * Presentation only: it owns no data and calls no service. The caller supplies
 * the membership and candidate lists and handles the two intents, so all state
 * and every mutation stay with the page that already owns them.
