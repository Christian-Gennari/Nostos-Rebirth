 * by, and watching it must not mean refetching the library — a refetch every
 * second would also re-order and re-render the page under the reader's hands.
 *
 * The connection is deliberately on demand:
 *   - it is opened only when there is work in flight, and closed as soon as the
 *     last import reaches a terminal state (an SSE stream left open 24/7 is a
 *     connection, a proxy slot and a wake-up every heartbeat, for nothing);
 *   - `onerror` surfaces 'reconnecting' instead of hanging silently, and every
 *     (re)connect re-reads GET /api/imports/active rather than assuming the
 *     events missed while it was down were buffered — they were not;
 *   - a terminal event fetches ONLY that one book and hands it to the library to
 *     patch in place.
