/**
 * App-wide colour theme.
 *
 * Ownership: this service is the ONLY writer of `data-theme` on
 * `<html>`. Everything else reads the resulting CSS custom properties, so a
 * component never needs to know which theme is active.
 *
 * The stylesheet is also the source of truth for what each theme *looks like*;
 * this file only decides which one is on. `styles.css` declares light on
 * `:root` and dark on `:root[data-theme='dark']`, which is what makes the
 * `data-theme="light"` case work without a second light block: removing the
 * attribute falls back to the `:root` defaults.
 *
 * Anti-flash: `index.html` runs a tiny inline script that applies the stored
 * theme before first paint. That script must stay in sync with
 * `readStoredTheme`/`STORAGE_KEY` below.
