         ask for a fill on the icon host, which the old stroke-drawn library could
         not honour — its svg carried fill="none", and an inherited value cannot
         override an element's own attribute, so the declaration was inert and a
         filled star was only ever a recoloured outline. The component's template
         now switches the glyph to the fill weight, which is what this rule was
         describing all along; the color below is what the solid glyph is
         painted with, and quotes are used here so a backtick cannot close the
         inline styles literal early (check:design guards this). */
