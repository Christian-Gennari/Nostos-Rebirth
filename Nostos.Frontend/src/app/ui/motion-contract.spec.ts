/**
 * Motion-contract gate: a loading skeleton must not come back, and the library
 * must not put anything in the content's place while it loads.
 *
 * Two rules, both learned the hard way:
 *
 * 1. A skeleton is a guessed structure — rows, bars, thumbnails at metrics that
 *    are never quite the real ones — so it jitters against the content it stands
 *    in for. A `skeleton` class, keyframe or markup block reappearing in a
 *    template or stylesheet is a regression, not a style choice.
 *
 * 2. The library goes further: during its cold load the results region is left
 *    EMPTY and simply holds its height, then the real results fade in over it.
 *    Nothing is drawn in the content's place at all — not even the shared
 *    structureless wait field (`.wait-field`, styles.css), which is still the
 *    right answer where a surface would otherwise sit blank for a longer,
 *    indeterminate read (book detail, the readers, the second brain).
 *
 * Scans templates and stylesheets under src/ (component styles included) and
 * reports every offending file. Comments count: naming the thing is how it
 * comes back.
