/**
 * Semantic icon vocabulary — Nostos product concepts, not glyphs.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS (and where it stops)
 * ------------------------------------
 * `<nostos-icon name="headphones" />` names a GLYPH. That is fine for a one-off
 * action, but a stable product concept must not be re-decided independently by
 * every surface: the Library's "audiobook" chip, the book row's format badge and
 * the audio reader's nav all mean the same thing, and they drift apart the moment
 * each picks its own glyph.
 *
 * So: a stable concept gets ONE entry here, and surfaces ask for the CONCEPT
 * (`<nostos-icon concept="audiobook" />`). This file is deliberately small. It is
 * a mapping, not a framework, and it must not grow to cover one-off actions —
 * those are named as glyphs at the call site.
 *
 * ADDING A CONCEPT
 * ----------------
 * Only when the concept is product-stable AND used in more than one place (or is
 * a top-level navigation destination). The target must be a registered glyph, so
 * `satisfies` fails the build otherwise.
