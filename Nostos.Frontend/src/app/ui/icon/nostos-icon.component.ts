/**
 * The general-purpose Nostos icon — for every icon that is NOT a button.
 *
 * Button glyphs go through `button[appIconButton]` (which renders this component
 * internally), because a button owns sizing, tone, hover and pressed semantics.
 * Everything else — nav rows, badges, empty states, inline affordances — is this.
 *
 * USAGE
 * -----
 *   <nostos-icon name="trash" />                       // a glyph
 *   <nostos-icon concept="audiobook" [size]="14" />    // a stable product concept
 *   <nostos-icon name="star" weight="fill" [size]="18" />
 *   <nostos-icon name="warning" [label]="'Sync failed'" />
 *
 * TWO WAYS IN, ON PURPOSE — `name` for a glyph, `concept` for a product idea.
 * A concept resolves through `NOSTOS_CONCEPTS`, so the ONE place that decides
 * "audiobook is headphones" is a mapping table, not 20 templates. One of the two
 * is required; `name` wins if both are given. Passing neither is a programming
 * error and throws loudly rather than rendering an invisible box.
 *
 * ACCESSIBILITY: DECORATIVE BY DEFAULT, OPT IN TO MEANING.
 * An icon with no `label` renders `aria-hidden="true"`. That is the correct and
 * overwhelmingly common case — the glyph repeats what the adjacent text or the
 * parent button already says, and a second announcement is noise. Setting
 * `[label]` (a string) switches the host to `role="img"` + `aria-label` for the
 * rare icon that carries meaning on its own. There is deliberately no third
 * option and no `decorative` flag to contradict the label.
 *
 * COLOR comes from `currentColor` (Phosphor draws with `fill="currentColor"`), so
 * an icon inherits its surface's semantic token for free and no call site sets an
 * icon colour. Size is the only inline style, and it is written as `width`/
 * `height` ATTRIBUTES on the svg so ordinary CSS can still override it.
 *
 * WHY `[innerHTML]` + `bypassSecurityTrustHtml`
 * ---------------------------------------------
 * The markup is a build-time constant imported from `@phosphor-icons/core` (see
 * the loader note in `nostos-icons.ts`); no user data ever reaches it, so the
 * sanitizer has nothing to protect against and would only strip the SVG. The
 * bypass is applied to that constant and nowhere else.
