/**
 * How the shell presents itself.
 *
 * `sheet` is a form dialog: on a phone it takes the whole screen (see the
 * component's stylesheet for why), and on a wide viewport it is the centred
 * dialog it has always been. `dialog` is a compact question — a confirmation —
 * which stays centred at every width, because filling a phone screen with one
 * sentence and two buttons reads as an error state rather than a question.

/**
 * The geometry of the dialogs in Nostos, in one place.
 *
 * Before this existed the backdrop, the card, the internally scrolling body and
 * the pinned action row were copy-pasted into each dialog (`add-book-modal`,
 * `editions-modal`, `confirm-modal`), so "what a dialog looks like on a phone"
 * meant three edits and usually missed one. The shell owns that geometry.
 *
 * Callers own their content, including their own close control — every form
 * dialog here already has one, styled to its own header, and a second one
 * rendered by the shell would only be a duplicate to keep in sync.
 *
 * The regions, top to bottom:
 *
 * - `[shellHeader]` — pinned. The caller's header markup, padding and divider
 *   supplied by the shell.
 * - `[shellTabs]` — optional, pinned, never scrolls (a tab strip that scrolls
 *   away is a tab strip you cannot use).
 * - default projection — the scrolling body.
 * - `[shellActions]` — pinned action row.
 *
 * Only the body scrolls, so the close control and the primary action stay
 * reachable however long the content is.
