/**
 * The view toggle — one segmented control for switching how a page presents the
 * same data (Library: list ⇄ grid, Brain: list ⇄ map).
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS AS A COMPONENT, AFTER THE RECIPE SAID NOT TO EXTRACT ONE
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 * `styles.css` used to carry `.toggle-opt` as a shared *recipe* plus a long
 * comment arguing the markup should stay duplicated, because the four segmented
 * surfaces have four different interaction contracts (Studio: role="tablist";
 * Settings: radiogroup; Brain/Library: role="group" + aria-pressed). That
 * reasoning is still right about FOUR surfaces and still wrong about TWO: the
 * Library and the Brain are the same control with the same contract, shipped as
 * two byte-identical hand-copies whose CSS had already drifted apart once (one
 * copy got the focus ring, the other did not, so the same control behaved
 * differently for keyboard users depending on the page).
 *
 * So this component covers exactly the two that ARE one control, and Studio's
 * tabs and Settings' theme choice are deliberately NOT migrated: they need
 * different semantics (tab and radio roles, visible text labels, roving
 * selection that changes a page's structure), and generalising this into
 * `role`/`aria` inputs would be the leaky abstraction the old comment predicted.
 * Their chrome stays where it is.
 *
 * THE HOST IS THE TRACK, AND IT KEEPS THE LEGACY CLASS HOOKS
 * ---------------------------------------------------------
 * The host element carries whatever classes the call site writes
 * (`class="control-group"` in the Library, `class="control-group view-mode-control"`
 * in the Brain). That is load-bearing, not cosmetic:
 *
 *  - the two surface stylesheets and their specs select the track by those
 *    classes, and so does `e2e/brain-library-parity.spec.ts`, which exists to
 *    assert the two surfaces render the SAME control — with one component that
 *    parity is now structural instead of a CSS coincidence;
 *  - it lets a surface keep a LAYOUT-only declaration (the Brain pins
 *    `flex: 0 0 auto` so the toolbar cannot squeeze the track) while the control
 *    itself owns its chrome.
 *
 * WHAT IS NEW COMPARED TO THE RECIPE IT REPLACES
 * ----------------------------------------------
 *  1. A sliding thumb (220ms, --ease-out) instead of a static fill. The thumb is
 *     positioned from `--vt-index` by `calc()` — no measuring, no ResizeObserver,
 *     and it stays correct across the breakpoint that changes the option width.
 *  2. The selected glyph steps `light` → `regular`. `fill` was prototyped and
 *     rejected: at 18px on a dark track the filled glyph read as a bright blob,
 *     heavier than any other selected state in the app.
 *  3. A quiet hover wash on the option that is NOT selected. The old recipe marked
 *     hover on the ink only, so the two halves of the control felt different.
 *  4. Arrow keys. The control is a `role="group"` of pressed buttons, so it gets
 *     the segmented-control keyboard contract the web expects: one tab stop
 *     (roving tabindex) plus Arrow/Home/End, rather than two Tab presses.
 *  5. A 1px inner top edge on the thumb (`--control-thumb-highlight`) so the
 *     selected option reads as RAISED on dark, where `--shadow-sm` is a black
 *     shadow on a near-black track and does nothing at all.
 *
 * The animation is suppressed for the very first paint (`afterNextRender`): a
 * thumb that slides in from the left on page load reads as a glitch, not as polish.
