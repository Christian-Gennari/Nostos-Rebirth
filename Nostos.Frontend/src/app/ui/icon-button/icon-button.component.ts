/**
 * A single icon button, replacing 30 hand-built copies across 5 templates.
 *
 * WHY AN ATTRIBUTE SELECTOR ON THE NATIVE BUTTON
 * ----------------------------------------------
 * `selector: 'button[appIconButton]'` means the HOST element is the real
 * `<button>`. That is not a stylistic preference, it is the only shape that
 * survives contact with this codebase:
 *
 *  - Native `disabled`, `type`, `(click)`, keyboard activation and `aria-*` keep
 *    working with no forwarding code.
 *  - One-off classes (`desktop-only`, `zen-toggle`, `overflow-toggle`) pass
 *    through untouched, so surface CSS that targets them is unaffected.
 *  - Descendant selectors keep matching. Several surfaces style the button from a
 *    scoped rule (`.reader-toolbar .icon-btn { border-radius: var(--radius-md) }`,
 *    `.doc-actions .icon-btn`, `.note-actions .icon-btn`) and specs query
 *    `.actions .icon-btn`. A custom wrapper element would break all of them, and
 *    a plain directive could not own an encapsulated stylesheet the way every
 *    other component in `src/app/ui/` does.
 *
 * The host therefore keeps the literal `icon-btn` class. That is load-bearing:
 * `styles.css` still carries `.icon-btn:hover`, `.icon-btn.delete:hover` and
 * `nostos-icon { top: 1px }` (the glyph nudge every surface relies on), and the
 * existing specs select on `.icon-btn`. The component adds the SIZING and SHAPE,
 * which is what the five copies each re-declared inconsistently.
 *
 * THE GLYPH IS A NAME, NOT AN ICON OBJECT
 * ---------------------------------------
 * `[icon]` takes a Nostos glyph name (`icon="trash"`), so this component —
 * and every one of its call sites — knows nothing about the icon library. The
 * name resolves through `nostos-icons.ts`, which is the single place a family or
 * a glyph can be changed. Passing icon data objects (the old `[icon]="Trash2Icon"`)
 * is what made a library swap a 22-file edit.
 *
 * `weight`, NOT `strokeWidth`
 * ---------------------------
 * The previous library drew with strokes, so call sites tuned `strokeWidth`
 * (1, 1.2, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, 1.75, 1.8, 2, 2.2 all appear). Phosphor draws with
 * filled geometry, so that knob does not exist; weight is the equivalent axis.
 * Two measurements decided the mapping.
 *
 * 1. WHAT THE OLD APP ACTUALLY PAINTED (live, on main). `lucide-angular`
 *    truncates via `parseInt`, so 1.2 / 1.5 / 1.6 / 1.75 / 1.8 all painted as
 *    `stroke-width: 1` and 2.2 painted as 2 — read off 146 rendered glyphs on
 *    /library: declared 1.5 -> svg `stroke-width="1"`, declared 2.2 -> "2".
 *    The painted range was therefore only ever {1, 2}.
 * 2. WHAT EACH WEIGHT IS (bar thickness in device px of a straight stroke at a
 *    256px render, both families rasterised side by side):
 *
 *      lucide    sw 1 -> 10px   sw 1.5 -> 16px   sw 2 -> 22px   sw 2.2 -> 24px
 *      phosphor  thin -> 8px    light  -> 12px   regular -> 16px   bold -> 24px
 *
 * So the DECLARED value is the honest guide — it is what the author asked for,
 * and the truncation was the old package's bug, not a design decision — and its
 * ratio against the default lands almost exactly on a Phosphor weight:
 *
 *      declared / 2 = 0.5-0.6  ->  thin     (0.50 of regular)
 *      declared / 2 = 0.7-0.9  ->  light    (0.75 of regular)
 *      declared / 2 = 1.0-1.1  ->  regular  (1.00)   <- and the default
 *
 * Deliberately NOT mapped by painted thickness alone: that lands the painted 2
 * on `bold` (22px -> 24px) and would make the whole app bold, which is the
 * opposite of the icon language this migration is standardising on. The visible
 * consequence of choosing `regular` is that the app's icons are FINER than
 * before: Phosphor regular is 16px where lucide's default 2 was 22px, so an
 * unspecified call site now paints ~27% thinner. That is the family's normal UI
 * weight, not a nudge, and it is the one judgement call in this file that is
 * worth a second opinion on the before/after screenshots.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT here: `data-tip`, the themed tooltip, and the `.delete`
 * fill-on-hover. Those stay in the surfaces that own them so this remains a
 * pure de-duplication and every migration is pixel-identical. Moving them is a
 * follow-up, not a refactor.
 *
 * THERE IS NO `active` INPUT, ON PURPOSE.
 * Every surface's selected state is styled by its own `.icon-btn.active` rule, and
 * because the host is the button a plain `[class.active]="tocOpen()"` keeps working
 * untouched. An `active` input emitting `icon-btn--active` would be a SECOND way to
 * express one state, and the two would drift.
 *
 * THERE IS NO `ariaLabel` INPUT, ON PURPOSE.
 * A host binding like `[attr.aria-label]="ariaLabel() || null"` OVERRIDES a
 * static `aria-label` written on the call site, so `<button appIconButton
 * aria-label="Edit book">` had its label silently replaced with nothing — a
 * real accessibility regression that no unit test caught and only the computed
 * probe did. Because the host IS the `<button>`, native attributes already pass
 * through untouched, so the input only ever added a way to lose the label.
 * Write `aria-label` (or `title`) on the call site directly.
