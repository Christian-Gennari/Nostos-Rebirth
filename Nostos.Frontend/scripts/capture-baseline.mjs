/**
 * Design-language baseline capture.
 *
 * A CSS refactor compiles perfectly while changing every surface, so the
 * acceptance test for this work cannot be `npm run build` — it has to be a
 * pixel-and-computed-value baseline taken from the RUNNING app.
 *
 * This captures, for each surface x viewport x theme:
 *   - a PNG at DPR 1 (artifact pixels are exact; downscaling hides defects)
 *   - a JSON of computed values clustered over the painted DOM
 *
 * It also records a BUILD FINGERPRINT. This matters: a previous audit session
 * measured a bundle that predated a merge to main, and every number it produced
 * described the old code. Every later diff must state which build it measured,
 * so the fingerprint is captured with the baseline rather than reconstructed
 * later.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/capture-baseline.mjs [--port 5214] [--out <dir>]
 *   node scripts/capture-baseline.mjs --theme dark --surface library
 *
 * Assumes an app is already serving (npm run prod / npm start). It does NOT
 * start one: a baseline captured against a freshly-started server would race
 * the build, which is the exact failure this harness exists to prevent.
