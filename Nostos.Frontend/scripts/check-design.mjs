/**
 * check-design.mjs — design-language drift scanner.
 *
 * Why this exists: over one change-set this repo shipped four regressions that
 * every existing check passed. `npm run check` verifies that CSS *parses* and
 * that colour tokens have dark counterparts; neither notices that
 *
 *   1. a `transition` lost its semicolon, swallowing the next declaration, so
 *      elements rendered black (valid CSS, all sheets "parse cleanly");
 *   2. a global dark override was load-bearing for a component that declared its
 *      own copy of the same class, so deleting the override silently reverted it;
 *   3. an invented token quietly moved a LIGHT-mode value;
 *   4. a token was deleted that a component actually consumed.
 *
 * Each rule below encodes one of those, at the level of *text*, so it runs in
 * the fast `npm run check` loop rather than needing a browser.
 *
 * Rules are deliberately few and each has been proven to fail on a real
 * instance (see --self-test). A scanner that cannot fail is worse than no
 * scanner, because it is trusted.

/**
 * RULE 5 — a global dark override that cannot win its specificity race.
 *
 * This is the #94 bug class, and it is the most expensive one in this repo: the
 * failure is invisible in review, does not error, and manifests in ONE theme.
 *
 * THE CORRECT ARITHMETIC (this was wrong at first, and the correction matters):
 *
 * A "compound" is a COMbinator-separated part, NOT a class. `.nav-item.active`
 * is ONE compound holding two classes. Angular's ShadowCss splits a selector on
 * combinators and appends exactly ONE `[_ngcontent-x]` attribute per compound —
 * so a compound's contribution goes from its own (0, b, c) to (0, b+1, c).
 *
 * Worked example, the badge that shipped broken:
 *   component: .nav-item.active .count-badge
 *     -> classes 3 + two injected attributes = (0,5,0)
 *   override : :root[data-theme='dark'] .nav-item.active .count-badge
 *     -> :root (pseudo-class 1) + [data-theme] (attribute 1) + classes 3 = (0,5,0)
 *
 * They TIE. The component wins because Angular appends component styles after
 * styles.css. So the failure is a tie broken by source order, not a loss.
 *
 * An earlier version of this comment (and of the design doc) claimed (0,6,0) vs
 * (0,5,0) by doubling a class count. That was a coincidence that reproduced the
 * right verdict for this one selector and is wrong in general: it miscounts
 * multi-class compounds, element selectors, IDs, `:not()`, `:is()`/`:where()`,
 * combinators and comma lists.
 *
 * CONSEQUENCE FOR THIS CHECK: because the arithmetic is an approximation over
 * real-world selectors, this rule is ADVISORY, not a hard gate. It reports; it
 * does not fail the build. Treat a finding as "measure this one in the browser",
 * and treat silence as no signal at all. The reliable detector for this bug class
 * is the paint sweep in both themes plus a pixel baseline, which is what actually
 * caught the original defect.
 *
 * The heuristic below deliberately over-estimates the GLOBAL side (it counts one
 * for `:root` and one for `[data-theme]`, plus one per compound) so that it errs
 * toward staying quiet rather than crying wolf on rules that are fine.
