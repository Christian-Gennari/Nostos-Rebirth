# Concept-map audit probes

Measurement scripts for the Second Brain concept map (Sigma.js + Graphology).
They exist because a WebGL graph cannot be inspected the way a DOM surface can:
there is no per-node element, no computed style to read, and a vision read of a
screenshot is unreliable — these probes were built after a vision pass called a
layout with **zero measured node overlaps** "clumped", and claimed a node was
clipped when measurement showed 74px of clear margin.

Every probe prints JSON and writes it to an output directory. Point them at a
running instance:

```sh
# against production (PM2 app `nostos`, port 5214)
node scripts/map-audit/crowding.mjs http://127.0.0.1:5214 /tmp/audit/crowding

# against a dev server (ng serve defaults to 4200)
node scripts/map-audit/crowding.mjs http://127.0.0.1:4200 /tmp/audit/crowding

# a theme-taking probe takes it as the 4th argument
node scripts/map-audit/dim-reducer.mjs http://127.0.0.1:5214 /tmp/audit/dim light
```

Output defaults to `.map-audit-out/` (gitignored). Pass an absolute path outside
the repo when you just want scratch results.

## Prerequisites

A **real browser** — these launch Chromium through Playwright, already a dev
dependency. They pass `--use-angle=swiftshader`, so they work without a GPU.
WebGL2 must be available: Sigma renders nothing without it.

They need the map's diagnostic handles, which the component publishes after
construction (`globalThis.__nostosSigma`, `__nostosGraph`). Those are read-only
introspection; no application behaviour depends on them.

## The probes

| Script | Question it answers |
| --- | --- |
| `crowding.mjs` | How close are nodes on screen? Counts pairs drawn closer than their combined radii, plus nearest-neighbour distances. A vision read of "hairball" is only actionable if it is measurable. |
| `labels.mjs` | How many labels actually render, and do they collide? Sweeps `labelDensity` and counts ink blobs on the label canvas (0 merged blobs = labels gained without collisions). |
| `dim-reducer.mjs` | **Preferred** dimming measurement. Asks the live `nodeReducer` what colour it gives a non-neighbourhood node, composites it over the field, and reports the true contrast. |
| `dim-elements.mjs` | Pixel-level dimming probe. Useful for a second opinion, but see the caveat below. |
| `trace2.mjs` | Can you tell which edges touch the focused node? Classifies the whole edge layer into accent vs normal ink and reports the balance focused vs unfocused. |
| `fit-oracle.mjs` | Is the graph correctly framed? Derives the ratio independently via `graphToViewport(..., { cameraState })` and compares it to what is shipped, **per viewport shape**. |
| `verify-prod.mjs` | End-to-end check on a deployed instance: framing, labels, off-screen nodes, console errors, in both themes. |
| `shots.mjs` | 1:1 captures of the map in both themes, for visual review. |
| `dogfood.mjs` | Exploratory pass over every surface — controls, focus mode, search, theme change, rapid clicks, repeated drags, mobile layout — reporting PASS/FAIL per check. |
| `mobile-layout.mjs` | Phone geometry: stage/card/viewport sizes, dead space below the map, side gutters, horizontal overflow, and touch-target sizes across a device matrix. |
| `mobile-detail.mjs` | The two phone defects a DOM probe cannot see: dead space under the card, and label ink drawn past the canvas edge (Sigma draws labels into a 2D canvas sized to the stage, so there is no box to measure). |
| `check-claims.mjs` | Does the bottom dock overlap the graph canvas, and how many nodes render inside the dock's band? Also prints every control's rendered size. |
| `landscape-rail.mjs` | In landscape, does the Index rail stay visible and squeeze the map? Reports the rail's share of the viewport width and the resulting stage size. |
| `why-landscape.mjs` | Prints which media queries the browser reports as matching and the resolved computed styles, for when a rule is in the source but clearly not applied. |
| `trace-heights.mjs` | Walks the ancestor chain from `.sigma-container` upward printing each element's resolved height and flex properties. When a flex chain collapses, the break is always at whichever ancestor first loses its own height. |
| `mobile-interact.mjs` | Drives the interactions a thumb actually performs — tap to select, the selection bar, Read notes, focus mode, pinch zoom, Fit, rotation both ways — and reports PASS/FAIL plus console errors. |
| `verify-all.mjs` | One run across desktop, laptop, tablet and phone viewports reporting framing fill, off-screen nodes, nodes/labels under chrome, undersized touch targets, and console errors. |
| `crowding-at.mjs` | `crowding.mjs` at an explicit viewport, so the SAME metric can be compared across stage SHAPES (`crowding.mjs` is desktop-only). Reports overlaps, nearest-neighbour distances, off-screen nodes and fill per axis. |
| `drag-physics.mjs` | The three claims that separate live physics from a frozen layout: do neighbours move DURING a drag, does the graph keep settling AFTER release (inertia), and does it then STOP (0 drift at idle). |
| `physics-calibrate.mjs` | Dose-response sweep of Obsidian's force constants over the real graph — settled extent, overlaps and nearest-neighbour distance per candidate. |
| `ship-calibration.mjs` | The same, modelled end-to-end through the camera fit and Sigma's own size mapping, across stage shapes. This is what picks the constants. |
| `scale-invariance.mjs` | Proves (or disproves) that the force set is scale-invariant, i.e. whether the length unit is free or has to be tuned per stage. |
| `live-loop-behaviour.mjs` | Does re-heating the layout on drag balloon the graph, and does it settle back to rest? Includes the control run that isolates a position rescale. |
| `layout-equilibrium.mjs` | How far nodes drift when the simulation is run on after settling — the measurement that shows a settled layout is NOT a force balance. |
| `framing-sweep.mjs` / `anisotropic-centering.mjs` | Whether a portrait stage can be filled by legitimate means (per-axis centering force) rather than by shearing settled coordinates. |

`fit-oracle.mjs` and `verify-prod.mjs` default to 5214 (production);
`crowding.mjs` and friends default to 4200 (dev server).

## Caveats worth knowing before you trust a number

- **Prefer the reducer over pixels for colour questions.** A node is a few pixels
  wide and `graphToViewport` returns fractional coordinates, so a "centre pixel"
  lands on an anti-aliased edge and *understates* the node's ink. A patch-max
  probe makes the opposite error and catches whatever dark edge crosses its box.
  Both mistakes were made while investigating the dimming; they disagreed with
  each other (82% vs 32% "contrast retained") while the reducer's answer — 44% —
  was the correct one.
- **Measure across viewport SHAPES, not just widths.** A landscape desktop
  viewport hides portrait-only bugs. A fit formula that divides by `max(W, H)`
  passes on a wide stage and silently under-fits a tall one; that shipped a zoom
  of 0.604 where 1.0 was needed, leaving 5 of 53 nodes off screen. `fit-oracle.mjs`
  covers desktop, portrait and squarish for this reason.
- **A WebGL canvas cannot be read with `getImageData`/`drawImage`** — the drawing
  buffer is not preserved and you get black. Isolate a layer by hiding the others
  and diffing two screenshots, and diff against the **modal colour** of the image
  rather than a corner pixel: a corner can land on a floating control.
- **Record baselines before your own interactions.** A capture that runs after a
  select/drag step measures a different state and will report a figure your change
  did not produce.
- **Key phone rules on height as well as width.** An 844x390 landscape phone is
  *wider* than the 768px breakpoint, so a `max-width: 768px` rule never applies to
  it: the Index rail stayed at 320px (38% of the screen), the map stage kept its
  desktop height and overflowed a 390px viewport, and the control strip covered 17
  nodes. Use `(max-width: 768px), (max-height: 500px)`.
- **A CSS rule that is present can still be inert.** `stagePadding` on the Sigma
  settings does nothing when `autoRescale` is false — its accessor returns 0 — and
  a media query written *inside* another media query is invalid CSS, so the whole
  block is discarded. Confirm with `getComputedStyle` (or `why-landscape.mjs`),
  never by grepping the stylesheet.
- **Fitting the tighter axis leaves the other one empty — but do NOT fix that by
  stretching.** `normalizeGraphPositions` scaled both axes by
  `min(scaleX, scaleY)`, which leaves the longer axis of a tall stage part empty,
  because a force-directed graph settles roughly square. Per-axis scaling fixes the
  fill and breaks the physics: the settle is not a force balance (600 further ticks
  at the same constants still move nodes by ~120px mean / 341px max), so the moment
  a drag re-heats the layout it re-expands toward its natural spacing — measured
  **2.03x** on a portrait stage when positions had been rescaled into stage units,
  against 1.03x without. Shearing also bought nothing: dropping it left a 369x707
  stage BETTER framed (fillY 0.426 -> 0.436). Keep the physics in one unit system,
  let the camera do a uniform fit, and accept that a wide stage has empty sides —
  that is what Obsidian does.
- **A settled layout is not an equilibrium, so "extra ticks" is not a correctness
  check.** Running 600 more ticks after alpha reaches the floor moves every node
  (mean 121px, max 341px). Alpha is an *energy budget*, not a force balance, and
  the layout halts on the budget. Any harness that assumes position stability at
  rest is measuring the wrong thing; measure alpha instead.
- **Sigma gates labels on the DRAWN radius, not the node's `size` attribute.**
  `scaleSize(data.size)` is what `labelRenderedSizeThreshold` is compared against,
  so switching `zoomToSizeRatioFunction` changes which nodes get labels without
  touching a single node size. Shipping the old threshold of 3.2 against
  `Math.sqrt` scaling silenced 47 of 53 labels.
- **Per-node `labelSize` does not exist.** `drawDiscNodeLabel` reads only
  `settings.labelSize`; the `labelColor.attribute` indirection applies to colour
  alone. A component can write a per-node label size onto every node and have it
  silently ignored.
- **A label drawn to the right of its node cannot be kept on a narrow canvas by
  reserving a gutter.** A long concept name needs ~140px of a 369px phone stage, so
  the reservation becomes the fit's binding axis and shrinks every node rather than
  the one word that overflows. Flip the label to the other side instead — that is
  what `drawFlipsAtEdgeNodeLabel` does, and it took edge ink on the label canvas
  from 7 to 0 while giving the map back 9 points of width fill.
- **A stale `vite-error-overlay` in the DOM swallows pointer events.** The probes
  install an init script that removes it, so a dev server's HMR error does not
  fail a run for reasons unrelated to the app.
