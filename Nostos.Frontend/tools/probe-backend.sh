# Library probe backend — development tooling, not part of the app runtime.
#
# The isolated Playwright fixture has an empty library, which is fine for
# chrome/geometry assertions and useless for judging a list view or measuring
# scroll cost. This launches the real backend over a SECOND loopback port so
# the probes can render real books and real cover art.
#
# How the real data is reached, and why it is safe:
#   * It runs from a git worktree, never the production working tree.
#   * `nostos.db` is COPIED into the worktree. The copy stays writable, because
#     startup runs EF migrations and SQLite takes a write lock to do so; a
#     read-only copy crashes the boot (verified). Safety comes from the copy
#     living outside the production tree, never from file permissions.
#   * `Storage/books` is a SYMLINK to the production book files. The backend
#     resolves it to <contentRoot>/Storage/books, so a symlink serves the real
#     covers and files without duplicating 13 GB. Nothing in the probe writes
#     book files.
#   * Both the copied DB and Storage/ are gitignored, so the snapshot can never
#     be committed.
#   * It binds 127.0.0.1:5099 from appsettings.Probe.json and never touches
#     PM2 or the production port (5214).
#
# Usage (from the worktree's Nostos.Frontend directory):
#   bash tools/probe-backend.sh                 # production checkout as source
#   bash tools/probe-backend.sh /path/to/checkout /tmp/probe-backend.log
#
# Then point a probe at it:
#   node tools/probe-library-views.mjs dist/Nostos.Frontend/browser out \
#     http://127.0.0.1:5099
