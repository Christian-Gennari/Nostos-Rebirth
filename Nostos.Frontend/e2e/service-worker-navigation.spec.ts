/**
 * Service-worker navigation policy — the API namespace must never be answered
 * with the Angular app shell.
 *
 * Regression guard for the "Download button sends me back to the library"
 * bug: the production build registers the Angular service worker
 * (`ngsw-worker.js`, see app.config.ts + ngsw-config.json). The worker treats
 * every navigation whose path matches `navigationUrls` as an app-shell
 * request (`/**` minus the default `*.*`/`__` exclusions), so a *dotless*
 * API URL such as `/api/books/{id}/file/download` was answered from the
 * app-shell cache with index.html. The router then matched its `**` route and
 * redirected to `/library` — the file never downloaded and the user was
 * thrown back to the home page.
 *
 * The fixture serves the real production build (service worker included) from
 * the real backend, so these tests exercise the shipped policy end to end:
 *   - an API download navigation must leave the worker for the network and
 *     deliver the exact bytes of the uploaded file;
 *   - the book-detail Download button (window.open) must download the file
 *     instead of opening another copy of the app;
 *   - the dotless backend namespaces (/api, /opds, /mcp) must reach the
 *     network on a navigation request;
 *   - client routes must still be answered from the worker's app-shell cache
 *     (asserted with the network switched off, which only the cache satisfies).
 *
 * Note: `Response.fromServiceWorker()` is NOT a discriminator here — for a
 * controlled page it is true for every response, including the ones the worker
 * passes through to the network (verified against this fixture).
 *
 * Known limitation, not covered here: `Mcp:Path` is configurable at runtime
 * (McpOptions), while `navigationUrls` is baked into the build. The exclusion
 * covers the default `/mcp`; a deployment that moves MCP to another absolute
 * path must add that path to ngsw-config.json too.
 *
 * The spec runs in the desktop project (playwright.config.ts testIgnore covers
 * the mobile project's `mobile.*.spec.ts` match).
