/**
 * Cohesion evidence for the Second Brain, seeded with realistic data.
 *
 * The earlier fixtures were 1-5 trivial concepts with no quotes, which is why the
 * design pass missed the quote presentation entirely: nothing on screen exercised
 * it. This seeds several books with mixed note kinds (quote + commentary,
 * quote-only, plain) so every card shape and every index state is represented,
 * then captures desktop and mobile in light and dark.
 *
 * Isolation: the fixture is shared and `visual-regression`'s empty-state test
 * requires it pristine, so this spec records the concept ids that existed before
 * it seeded and deletes only the ones it created (via `cleanupBrain`).
