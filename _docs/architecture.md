# Nostos — Architecture Overview

> **Status note (2026-08-12):** this overview predates the issue #34 library

> canonical library service; decision 1's fallback description has been
> corrected to the shipped method-constrained fallback. The remaining

## System Overview

Nostos is a self-hosted personal library and knowledge management platform. It combines an **ebook/audiobook reader**, a **note-taking system with wiki-style concept linking**, a **writing studio**, and a **collection management system** — all in a single deployable application.

## Key Architectural Decisions

### 1. Single-Binary Deployment

The Angular frontend is built and copied into the backend's `wwwroot/` directory at release time. The ASP.NET Core app serves both the API (`/api/*`, `/opds/*`) and the SPA (via `UseStaticFiles` + a custom method-constrained fallback: the shell is served for GET/HEAD client-side routes only, and `/api`, `/mcp`, and the configured MCP path are never answered by `index.html` — unknown paths there resolve as 404 and wrong verbs as 405).

### 2. Standalone Components (Angular)

The entire frontend uses Angular's standalone component model — no `NgModule` declarations anywhere. Components declare their own imports.

### 3. Signal-Based State Management

Angular Signals are used throughout instead of external state libraries (NgRx, Akita, etc.). Services expose reactive `signal()` properties and components use `computed()` for derived state.

### 4. Scroll Position Restoration

The Angular router is configured with `scrollPositionRestoration: 'enabled'` to automatically restore scroll position on back navigation. State preservation across navigation is handled at the service/store level using signals, not at the DOM level.

### 5. Repository Pattern (Backend)

All database access goes through interface-based repositories (`IBookRepository`, etc.), registered as scoped services. This separates data access from endpoint logic.

### 6. Minimal API Endpoints

The backend uses ASP.NET Core Minimal API pattern with extension method groups (`MapBooksEndpoints()`, etc.) rather than controllers.

### 7. File-Per-Book Storage

Book files and covers are stored in `Storage/books/{bookId}/` directories on-disk, not in the database. The database stores only metadata and file name references.

### 8. Wiki-Link Concept System

Notes use `[[Concept Name]]` syntax. The `NoteProcessorService` parses these on save, auto-creates concepts if new, and maintains a many-to-many `NoteConcepts` join table. A background worker (`ConceptCleanupWorker`) periodically removes orphaned concepts.

### 10. Automated Backup & Restore

Scheduled background workers (`BackupWorker`) create ZIP archives containing the database and book files. The system implements a maintenance mode (via middleware) that blocks API access during restoration to prevent data corruption.

## Integrations (MCP, Reading Training, Hermes)

The backend exposes two agent-facing surfaces on top of the same domain
services:

- **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** — opt-in (`Mcp:Enabled`, default disabled)
  bearer-authenticated Streamable HTTP endpoint at `/mcp` (`Mcp:Path`). The
  token is resolved exclusively from the `Mcp:ApiKeyEnvironmentVariable`
  environment variable (default `NOSTOS_MCP_TOKEN`) at startup; enabling MCP
  without the token fails startup closed. Tools are discovered from the
  assembly (`WithToolsFromAssembly`) and register as `mcp__nostos__*`
  (double underscore). The shipped surface is 34 tools: 23 Reading Training +
  11 Library (issue #34). The maintenance-mode guard covers the MCP route as
  well as `/api`.
- **Reading Training** — standalone domain with its own REST group
  (`/api/reading`, plus the `/api/reading-training` back-compat alias), MCP
  tools, and an optional Hermes connector. The connector is a thin transport:
  it routes the Telegram Reading topic and a Discord channel scope to
  `POST /api/reading/gateway/dispatch` with caller-supplied
  `(clientId, idempotencyKey)` and owns no state.

Canonical services are the only domain entry points: `ILibraryService`
(books and collections) and `IReadingTrainingService` (training) receive
every command — REST endpoints, the Angular UI, and MCP tools all forward to
them, and the endpoint/MCP layers hold no domain rules (thin connector
doctrine). Books are added through `library_create_or_match_book` (or the
legacy-permissive REST create); the earlier raw-curl add-book recipe is
superseded.

Both domains are exact-once on `(clientId, idempotencyKey)` receipts and a
state version: `LibraryCommandReceipt` keys on `(ClientId, IdempotencyKey)`
(client id ≤ 64 chars, key ≤ 128 chars, enforced by the
`CK_LibraryCommandReceipts_Bounds` CHECK constraint; fixed MCP client
`nostos-mcp`), and the `LibraryState` singleton carries the version string
returned in every envelope (`{ reply, data, stateVersion, duplicate }`, where
`duplicate=true` only on receipt replay). Book identity is normalized at
write time: checksum-validated ISBN/ASIN feed filtered unique indexes
(`NormalizedIsbn`/`NormalizedAsin`), and title+author matching uses
normalized text (both required for an exact match). `DatabaseBootstrapService`
migrates on startup, backfills normalized identity — a preflight
duplicate-identifier check aborts startup with an actionable error — and
seeds the `LibraryState` row.

## Data Flow

```
User Action → Angular Component
  → Service (HttpClient)
    → /api/* endpoint
      → Repository (EF Core)
        → SQLite DB
      ← Model
    ← DTO
  ← Signal Update
← Reactive UI Update
```

## Communication

- **Frontend ↔ Backend:** REST over HTTP (JSON)
- **Dev Proxy:** Angular dev server proxies `/api` and `/opds` to `http://localhost:5099`
- **Production:** Backend serves frontend directly from `wwwroot/`
