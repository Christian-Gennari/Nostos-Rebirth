/// (see <c>IAiProviderConfigResolver</c>). Availability is DERIVED, not a manual
/// server boolean — see <c>EffectiveAiProviderConfig.IsAvailable</c>.
/// <see cref="Enabled"/> is only a hard kill switch and defaults ON, so a
/// configured gateway is usable without anyone editing configuration. When the
/// assistant is unavailable the endpoints are still mapped, but answer with a
/// typed "not configured"/"disabled" error rather than calling a provider or
/// 500-ing. The credential is never read from configuration — only the NAME of
/// the environment variable that holds it — so a committed key is impossible and
/// nothing can be shipped to the Angular client.
///
/// The default <see cref="Model"/> must be a model that ACTUALLY CALLS TOOLS.
/// The 9Router free pool that used to sit here silently ignored the tool
/// definitions: measured against the gateway, the identical request returned
/// <c>finish_reason: "stop"</c> with zero tool calls, so every capture, search
/// and suggestion the assistant described had in fact not run. Do not put a
/// pooled/multi-vendor id back here without proving tool calling works.
