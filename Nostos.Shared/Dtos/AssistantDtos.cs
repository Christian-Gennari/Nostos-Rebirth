// --- ASSISTANT BRIDGE WIRE CONTRACT (issue #261 §3, decision D2) ---
// The Angular assistant shell sends one structured turn and receives the reply,
// any deterministic follow-up question, non-mutating suggestions, and a pending
// plan to approve later. The context DTO mirrors the frontend context service
// field-for-field (the names in the 261-S2 brief); it is deliberately not a
// superset and carries no field the client does not already resolve.

/// <summary>
/// One assistant turn. <paramref name="ClientId"/> and
/// <paramref name="IdempotencyKey"/> flow straight through to
/// <c>notes_capture</c>, so a retried turn cannot create a second note.
