# Public product and private hosted-service handoff

Tracking: #438 and #462. The repository boundary is recorded in the
[public/private boundary ADR](../adr/cloud-public-private-boundary.md).

## Current ownership

`Nostos-Rebirth` is the canonical public product repository. It owns
`Nostos.Product`, the SelfHosted SQLite/local-filesystem host, local backup and
restore, the BYOK assistant path, portability, capability contracts and the one
Angular frontend.

`Nostos-Cloud` is the private official hosted composition. It pins a public commit
and supplies hosted identity, PostgreSQL tenant persistence, commercial
entitlements/billing, managed AI, hosted object storage, operator recovery and
release operations. It does not contain copied Library, Brain, Reader, Studio,
Notes, domain or Angular source.

The public SelfHosted build has no dependency on the private repository. The hosted
capability values remain part of the public product contract so the same frontend
can present the correct controls when served by the private host.

## Change order

1. Make reusable product, domain, frontend and provider-neutral contract changes
   in public Nostos and merge them first.
2. Update the private repository's submodule pointer to the exact merged public
   commit; record and verify the pin pair.
3. Keep hosted implementations and operations in `Nostos-Cloud`.
4. Run public SelfHosted acceptance without private credentials and private
   boundary/host CI for every relevant change.

Public CI rejects private project, package, source and workflow dependencies. It
also runs SelfHosted/SQLite and portability regressions. Private CI validates the
exact public pin and rejects copied canonical product source outside its submodule.

## Cutover state

The private host authority promotion is represented by #462. Isolated
provider-backed staging parity/security evidence remains a prerequisite before
the hosted release is operationally promoted. Keep the last known-good hosted
artifact available for rollback during the transition. This work does not include production infrastructure changes. The private host now owns those decisions; the current paid-production direction keeps PostgreSQL on Neon rather than depending on a later provider migration.
