- Remember playback speed per audiobook

**Files to touch:** `audio-reader.component.*`

---

### 1.6 Reading Progress Dashboard
**Impact:** Low | **Effort:** Medium | **Area:** Reading

Progress is only visible inline in readers. No holistic view of reading habits.

- New "Reading Stats" section accessible from Library
- Metrics: Books completed, pages read, hours listened, current reading streak
- Simple bar/line visualizations
- Per-book reading history (started, finished, time spent)

---

### 1.7 Highlights as Primary Artifact
**Impact:** Low | **Effort:** Low | **Area:** Reading

Highlights are secondary to notes. Users may want to collect highlights without writing notes.

- "Highlights" view per book — shows all highlights without associated notes
- Bulk highlight export (Markdown, plain text)
- Optional highlight color coding

---

## 2. Library Management

### 2.1 Bulk Operations
**Impact:** High | **Effort:** High | **Area:** Library

No multi-select exists. Each book can only be acted on individually.

- Add checkbox multi-select on book cards/rows
- Batch actions: Delete, Move to Collection, Update reading status, Rate
- "Select all in current view" option
- Confirmation dialog for destructive batch operations

**Files to touch:** `library.component.*`, `books.service.ts`, backend batch endpoints

---

### 2.2 Library Import (Calibre / OPDS / Bulk)
**Impact:** Medium | **Effort:** High | **Area:** Library

No import from Calibre, OPDS, or bulk file drop exists.

- Calibre metadata import via `calibre-tools` or direct SQLite access
- OPDS feed subscription/import
- Bulk file drop — scan folder for EPUB/PDF/audio files, auto-match via ISBN/filename
- Progress indicator for large imports

---

### 2.3 Drag Books into Collections
**Impact:** Medium | **Effort:** Medium | **Area:** Library

Collections can be drag-reordered, but books cannot be dragged into collections from the grid.

- Enable CDK drag-drop from book grid to collection sidebar item
- Visual drop indicator on collection folders
- "Move to..." context menu on book cards as alternative

**Files to touch:** `library.component.*`, `sidebar-collections.component.*`

---

### 2.4 Filter by Reading Progress
**Impact:** Medium | **Effort:** Low | **Area:** Library

Cannot filter to "books 50% complete" or similar.

- Add progress-based filter: Not Started, In Progress, Near Finished (>80%), Finished
- Add slider filter: "Books between X% and Y%"
- Combine with existing status filters

**Files to touch:** `library.component.*`, backend filter logic

---

### 2.5 Author Filter and Series Navigation
**Impact:** Medium | **Effort:** Low | **Area:** Library

Can search by author but cannot filter to all books by one author. Series info is shown but not navigable.

- Author page: all books by that author, grouped by series
- Series detail: shows all books in series with read status
- Click author name → author page

**Files to touch:** `library.component.*`, backend: author listing endpoint

---

### 2.6 Grid/List Preference Persistence
**Impact:** Low | **Effort:** Low | **Area:** Library

View mode choice is not persisted across sessions.

- Save preference to localStorage
- Apply on app load

---

### 2.7 Collection Book Count
**Impact:** Low | **Effort:** Low | **Area:** Library

Sidebar shows collection name but not book count.

- Show count badge on each collection in sidebar
- Compute from backend or derive from existing data

---

## 3. Knowledge Graph (Brain)

### 3.1 Concept Graph Visualization
**Impact:** High | **Effort:** High | **Area:** Brain

No graph visualization exists. The concept system is purely list-based.

- Add graph view toggle in Brain (list ↔ graph)
- Use D3.js force-directed or Cytoscape.js for visualization
- Nodes = concepts, edges = co-occurrence in notes
- Zoom, pan, click to navigate
- Performance: lazy-load edges, limit to N most-connected concepts

**Files to touch:** `second-brain.component.*`, new graph component, add D3/Cytoscape dep

---

### 3.2 Orphan Concept Management UI
**Impact:** Medium | **Effort:** Medium | **Area:** Brain

Orphan cleanup runs hourly in background. Users cannot see or manage orphaned concepts.

- "Orphaned concepts" section in Brain settings/view
- Show concepts with zero linked notes
- Actions: Delete, Merge into another concept, Add note to rescue

**Files to touch:** `second-brain.component.*`, backend orphan endpoint

---

### 3.3 Concept Creation / Deletion UI
**Impact:** Medium | **Effort:** Medium | **Area:** Brain

Concepts are only auto-created via `[[Name]]` syntax in notes. No manual creation or deletion.

- "New Concept" button in Brain
- Manual concept deletion with confirmation
- "Protect from orphan" concept toggle (prevent auto-cleanup)

---

### 3.4 Concept Merging and Renaming
**Impact:** Low | **Effort:** Medium | **Area:** Brain

No way to merge duplicate concepts or rename them.

- Select source → merge into target concept
- All `[[OldName]]` references across notes auto-update
- Rename with same reference update

---

### 3.5 Usage Count Sorting Toggle
**Impact:** Low | **Effort:** Low | **Area:** Brain

Cannot toggle sort order in concept index.

- Add sort options: Most used first (default), A-Z, Z-A, Newest
- Persist preference

---

## 4. Writing Studio

The Writing Studio has a three-panel layout (file tree | editor | context sidebar) that feels like a code editor, not a writing environment. Writers need immersion and focus features.

### 4.1 Zen Mode
**Impact:** High | **Effort:** Medium | **Area:** Studio

Full-screen writing environment. Hides the dock, file tree, context sidebar, and toolbar — editor fills the entire viewport.

- Toggle via `Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+Z` or a "Zen" button in editor header
- Escape key or `Cmd/Ctrl+\` to exit
- Floating word count bar at bottom (fades after 3s of no interaction, reappears on mouse move)
- Background: subtle paper texture or solid dark/sepia per theme
- Remembers last mode (Zen or normal) per document

**Files to touch:** `writing-studio.component.*`, `styles.css`

---

### 4.2 Typewriter Mode
**Impact:** Medium | **Effort:** Low | **Area:** Studio

Long documents cause fatigue when the cursor is at the top of the screen. Typewriter mode keeps the current line vertically centered.

- Toggle in editor toolbar or Zen mode options
- Current line stays fixed at 40-50% from viewport top
- Smooth scroll follows cursor — document scrolls beneath a fixed cursor position
- Works in both normal and Zen mode

**Files to touch:** `writing-studio.component.*`, `markdown-editor.component.*`

---

### 4.3 Reference Overlay (Zen-Compatible)
**Impact:** Medium | **Effort:** Medium | **Area:** Studio

In Zen mode, users still need to pull in concepts and notes without restoring the full three-column layout.

- `Cmd/Ctrl+O` opens concepts/books as a floating overlay panel
- Search and click to insert reference, panel auto-hides when you start typing
- Last 3 inserted references shown as dismissible pills above the panel
- Works in Zen mode; does not restore full layout

**Files to touch:** `writing-studio.component.*`, `concept-autocomplete.*`

---

### 4.4 Writing Stats Bar
**Impact:** Low | **Effort:** Low | **Area:** Studio

Writers want feedback without switching context.

- Persistent bar at bottom: word count, character count, estimated reading time
- Toggle visibility per preference
- Fades in Zen mode until mouse movement

**Files to touch:** `writing-studio.component.*`

---

### 4.5 Writing Goals and Stats
**Impact:** Low | **Effort:** Medium | **Area:** Studio

No writing productivity features exist yet.

- Writing streak tracker
- Word count goals (daily/weekly)
- Session writing time per document
- Display in Studio sidebar or separate dashboard

---

### 4.6 Improved Reference Insertion
**Impact:** Low | **Effort:** Low | **Area:** Studio

Reference insertion currently only supports blockquote format.

- Insert as footnote-style reference
- Insert as hyperlinked title
- Remember last-inserted reference

---

## 5. Mobile & PWA

### 5.1 PWA Installability
**Impact:** High | **Effort:** Medium | **Area:** Mobile

Not installable as an app. No manifest, no service worker.

- Add `manifest.webmanifest` with icons, name, theme colors
- Configure Angular service worker (`ngsw-config.json`)
- Register service worker in `app.config.ts`
- Add maskable icons for home screen

---

### 5.2 Touch Gesture Navigation
**Impact:** Medium | **Effort:** Medium | **Area:** Mobile

No swipe gestures for page navigation in readers.

- Swipe left/right to navigate pages in EPUB/PDF
- Pinch-to-zoom for PDF
- Double-tap to bookmark in EPUB
- Integrate HammerJS or implement via touch event listeners

---

### 5.3 BreakpointObserver Refactor
**Impact:** Low | **Effort:** Low | **Area:** Mobile

Writing Studio uses manual `window.innerWidth` checks instead of Angular CDK `BreakpointObserver`.

- Replace `isMobile = signal(window.innerWidth < 768)` with `BreakpointObserver`
- More robust handling of orientation changes
- Consistent with Angular best practices

---

## 6. Onboarding

### 6.1 Guided First-Run Experience
**Impact:** High | **Effort:** High | **Area:** Onboarding

No onboarding flow. New users land directly in an empty library.

- Welcome modal on first visit
- Guided steps: (1) Add your first book, (2) Create a note, (3) Link a concept, (4) Explore OPDS
- Skip option with "Don't show again"
- Progress dots / step indicator

---

### 6.2 Sample Library / Demo Content
**Impact:** Medium | **Effort:** Medium | **Area:** Onboarding

Empty state is blank. Users don't know what the app looks like with content.

- "Load sample library" button in empty state
- Bundled sample EPUB with pre-populated notes and concept links
- Demonstrates the full feature set without any setup

---

## 7. Export & Interoperability

### 7.1 OPDS Subscription Updates
**Impact:** Medium | **Effort:** Medium | **Area:** Export

OPDS catalog is read-only. Cannot subscribe to updates from other apps.

- OPDS 2.0 or updated 1.2 with pagination
- Incremental feed updates
- Allow third-party apps to sync reading progress back via OPDS

---

### 7.2 Export Highlights and Notes
**Impact:** Medium | **Effort:** Low | **Area:** Export

Cannot export notes/highlights in bulk.

- Export all notes for a book as Markdown
- Export all highlights as formatted text or Markdown
- Export all notes across library as JSON
- Export to Obsidian-compatible format (Markdown files with `[[Concept]]` links)
